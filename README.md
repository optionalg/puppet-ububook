# NAME

Puppet masterless solution for my notebook

# SYNOPSYS

`puppet apply /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp`

# DESCRIPTION

This is an ordinary masterless Puppet configuration
included with modules to install in relatively small
environments (I personally use it at home).

It is based on DigitalOcean's howto, and this way a lot
of thanks to the guys there.
